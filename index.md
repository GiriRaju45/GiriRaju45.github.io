# அனைவருக்கும் வணக்கம் 🙏 Hello all! 

👋 Hi, 

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer specializing in  **NLP**, **speech synthesis** and **generative AI**. Currently at[Hitloop](https://hitloop.com), I’m building real-time Indian language dubbing systems using neural TTS and building voice cloning systems. I previously contributed to building expressive, speech synthesis models at [AI4Bharat, IIT Madras](https://ai4bharat.iitm.ac.in), where I developed high-quality datasets, models for Indian languages and internal tools/applications. I have previously interned at [unscript.ai](https://www.unscript.ai), [visionNLP.ai](https://www.visionnlp.com).

My experience spans **Generative AI with LLMs**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with [professional courses, projects and certifications](./certifications), and practical model development in **language, audio, and speech applications**. I also contribute to open-source and research with [publications](./publications) at INTERSPEECH and NeurIPS.

I hold a BE in Computer Science and Engineering, specializing in AI and ML from Annamalai University, Tamil Nadu. 

I love building things that are impactful, helpful for the people and contribute to the overall growth.
